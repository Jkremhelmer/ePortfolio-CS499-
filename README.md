# ePortfolio-CS499-

## Self Assesment
I decided to get my computer science degree to further my education and make myself a better team member. Back in 2018 when I started my journey, I was unsure of where it would take me. I started slowly taking one class at a time to see if it was what I wanted to do. Within the first two years, I had to step away from school due to work needs, at that time I was unsure if I was going ot be able to get back to it. In 2022, however, I was back in it, and on my way to where I am today. I have learned so much along the way and have a lot more to learn. 

During my time at SNHU I have learned many important lessons. These lessons will be carried with me through my career and all aspects of my life. The knowledge I gained at SNHU, coupled with the software engineers that allowed me to learn from them, I have gained a lot of knowledge and experience over the last few years. The tutelage the professors at SNHU have provided will go a long way into making me a better person, and SW engineer. The path of growth that this degree has set me on will continue throughout my life. I am looking forward to learning and developing new things that will help make the world a better place to be. I have learned what using industry best practices are, the value in peer reviews and team environments. I have learned different ways of analyzing code which has helped me learn and develop skills I will need to be a better SW engineer.

The artifacts I have used to demonstrate my skills were used since I realized I am interested in 3D graphical design. I plan to use the knowledge I have learned to create images that people may enjoy. I also plan on using the knowledge that I have gained to assist my peers in developing projects for our clients that meet and exceed industry standards as well as giving them the product they want and more. 

### Team Environments
Throughout my education, I have been fortunate enough to have online learning through SNHU, as well as tutelage from my peers at Lockheed Martin. I have learned how to use collaboration tools such Slack for team collaboration and GitHub for managing code while we work on
projects, or similar code together. While working in these Agile environments it was important to have SCRUMs to stay on track. Having a SCRUM master to report issues to and get tasked to a team member who is stronger in certain areas is key to a great product. It is very important to keep up with SCUMs as if their team is not on the same page, a project can quickly get out of hand. With that being said, the use of the collaboration tools goes a long way in being able to review others’ work, and make sure everyone is heading in the same direction.

### Communicating to Stakeholders
Along with communicating with team members, another important piece is communicating with stakeholders. One of the courses taught me how important this was. It also taught me the Unified Modeling Language (UML). In most instances the POC (Point of Contact) is the project
manager (PM), they are the ones who have the most interface with the stakeholders. They ensure that what the stakeholders are asking is what they are getting, conversely, they also make sure that expectations of the stakeholders aren't unrealistic. It is important that all parties are clear to the expectations of the project before it begins. This is where UML comes into play. Prior to the start of a project, developers should form a UML of the system that covers the scope provided by the stakeholders. During this time, developers can assess whether to not what is asked is feasible within the time and budget given by the stakeholders. Some of the requested features may be left out due to time or budget restrictions. Once the UML is written up, developers can get an overview of the system prior to coding begins, and give feedback as needed. In doing this, it ensures all parties are level set in what to expect, and developers can provide the best quality product. 

### Data Structures and Algorithms
There have been many concepts that I have learned along the way in my CS journey. During CS260: Data Structures and Algorithms, I learned the importance of how applications structure, effective storage methods, as well as using algorithms to reduce memory overhead of
applications. I also learned through this course and my peers, the complexity and timing of hash tables, vectors, binary search trees, and when is the appropriate time for each. In doing so it has helped me learn and understand data structures which allow me to choose
the ones that I feel are most appropriate for the given task. This in turn allows me to write more efficient code.  

### Software Engineering and Databases
In my educational journey I have been introduced to many database structures including SQL and MongoDB. In doing so, I was able to become more familiar with both relational database designs as well as object-oriented database designs. I learned how to use and create CRUD
models (Create, Read, Update, Delete). This allows me to interact with my databases, perform queries, as well as advanced concepts like pipeline aggregation. The use of these tools is key due to databases being a critical part in almost all applications. With this
knowledge I will be a better SW engineer and have the knowledge I need to succeed. 

### Security
There are many factors that go into the security aspect of software engineering. One being the risk of posting intellectual property online for public consumption could lead to others using the work without consent. It could also lead to plagiarism if someone else claimed it as their work. There could be claims of infringement, this could happen if your IP inadvertently included elements that have been copyrighted by others. You also risk exposing trade secrets if you post detailed information about the processes you use. Another security factor is making sure that all sensitive information is encrypted and kept away from public servers. If private information were to be obtained by someone who it does not belong to, or is used in a malicious way, you as the host of the information could be found liable. This could have far reaching affects, not only on your company, but also the developer of the code who is entrusted with developing a safe and secure product. 

### Inclusion
For the project, I chose one artifact to update in all three fields: Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structure, and Databases. The artifact I chose was from CS330: Comp Graphic and Visualization to demonstrate my abilities to create an artifact that is well commented, clean, and comprehensive. With focusing on one artifact, I was able to improve its readability, functionality, as well as its real-life application. I accomplished this by improving the code structure, removing redundant coding, updating some of the algorithms to make for smoother movements, as well as making it more efficient in order to use less memory while running.

## [Choosen Artifact] (https://github.com/Jkremhelmer/ePortfolio-CS499-/tree/main/Original)
My artifact comes from CS330: Comp Graphic and Visualization. It is a simple 3D image compiled from a 2D picture. The reason I chose this artifact is my interst in 3D graphical design work.

## [Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering] (https://github.com/Jkremhelmer/ePortfolio-CS499-/tree/main/Enhancement%201)
### Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created
The artifact that I am using is a scene from CS330. It is a basic 3D scene rendered from a 2D image. The initial code was created by Brian Battersby – SNHU Instructor, Nov 1st, 2023. My work with this code was completed Oct 19th, 2024. 

### Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How was the artifact improved?
I am including this artifact in my ePortfolio, as this is what I would like to do with my CS knowledge. I would like to create 3D renderings for people to enjoy. The components that I will be using to showcase my abilities are in the SceneManager.cpp. This is where the meat and potatoes are for the scene. I have improved efficiency in the code, removed redundant coding, corrected errors in some of the codework, as well as commented on the sections of improvement. 

### Did you meet the course outcomes you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans?
I am working on meeting my plans outlined in module 1. By the completion of this course, I will have either completed the planned updates or revised the plan to coincide with the updates I have made. 

### Reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face?
While I was improving on the code I am learning that some of the planned improvements are going to be more complicated that originally thought. As I am going through, I am learning new techniques to improve and modify code. Some of the challenges I faced were just the way to update the code. I have the concept in my head, just putting it into action is harder than anticipated.
